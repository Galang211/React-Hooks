# React Hooks

React Hooks is a feature introduced by React version 16.8 to enable the use of React features, such as state and lifecycle methods, in functional components without the need to use component classes. Hooks provide a simpler and cleaner way to manage state and side effects in functional components.

Here are some common hooks in React:

- useState()
  
  useState() is a hook provided by React to manage state in functional components. By using useState(),
  you can add state to a functional component and update its value.With useState(),
  functional components can have state and respond to state changes without writing a component class.
  This is a key part of the React Hooks paradigm that allows you to use React features inside functional components.

- useEffect()

  useEffect is one of the React Hooks used to handle side effects in functional components. Side effects are actions that are not directly related to rendering the     component view, such as API calls, DOM steps, or state updates based on certain changes. useEffect allows us to run side effect code after rendering the component.

  Common uses of useEffect are to perform tasks such as subscribing to external data sources, cleaning up resources,
  or performing changes based on state or prop   changes.
